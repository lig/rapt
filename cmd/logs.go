This command can list previous job runs for a tool or display logs for a specific job.
If no job name is provided, it lists all previous runs for the tool.
If a job name is provided, it displays the logs for that specific job.

Examples:
  rapt logs echo-tool                    # List previous runs for echo-tool
  rapt logs echo-tool echo-tool-20250115-143022  # Show logs for specific job
  rapt logs db-migrate --follow         # Follow logs for the latest job
  rapt logs my-tool --tail 100          # Show last 100 lines of logs`,
